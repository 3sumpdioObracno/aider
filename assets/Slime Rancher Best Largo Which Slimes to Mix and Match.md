Largo slimes are larger slimes that are created by feeding a slime a plort different from its own. They can produce two types of plorts at once, and they also inherit the traits and behaviors of their source slimes. This means that you can customize your largo slimes to suit your preferences and needs.
 
However, there are some things to consider when choosing your largo slime combinations. First, you need to make sure that they are compatible with each other and with their environment. For example, you don't want to mix a phosphor slime with a boom slime, because they will explode and fly away. You also don't want to mix a mosaic slime with a tangle slime, because they will grab food and plorts from nearby corrals and cause chaos.

Second, you need to consider their diet and favorite food. Some slimes have a more limited diet than others, and some have a specific favorite food that doubles their plort production. For example, quantum slimes only eat fruits, and their favorite food is phase lemon. By combining them with another fruit-eating slime, such as pink slime or honey slime, you can simplify their feeding process and increase their plort output.
 
Third, you need to consider their plort value and demand. Some plorts are more valuable than others, and some have more fluctuations in the market. For example, dervish plorts and tangle plorts are worth 75 Newbucks each[^1^], but they also have high volatility. By combining them with another high-value plort, such as mosaic plort or crystal plort, you can maximize your profit and reduce the risk of losing money.
 
Based on these criteria, here are some of the best largo slime combinations in Slime Rancher:
 
- Honey-Hunter Largo: This combination is one of the easiest and most profitable ones to make. Both slimes are docile and fruit-eaters, and their favorite food is mint mango[^2^]. Their plorts are worth 45 and 60 Newbucks each[^2^], making them a steady source of income.
- Quantum-Crystal Largo: This combination is one of the most powerful and challenging ones to manage. Both slimes have unique abilities that can cause trouble if not handled properly. Quantum slimes can teleport and create ghostly copies of themselves[^3^], while crystal slimes can create sharp spikes on the ground[^3^]. However, if you can keep them happy and contained, they will reward you with plorts worth 65 and 70 Newbucks each[^3^]. Their diet is also fruit-based, with their favorite food being phase lemon[^3^].
- Mosaic-Dervish Largo: This combination is one of the most beautiful and dangerous ones to create. Both slimes are found in the Glass Desert, and they have stunning appearances that reflect light and color[^4^]. However, they also have destructive tendencies that can harm you and your ranch. Mosaic slimes can create fire patches that ignite anything nearby[^4^], while dervish slimes can create tornadoes that fling objects around[^4^]. If you can control their chaos, they will produce plorts worth 75 Newbucks each[^4^]. Their diet is veggie-based, with their favorite food being silver parsnip[^4^].

These are just some examples of the best largo slime combinations in Slime Rancher. There are many more possibilities to explore and experiment with, so feel free to try out different combinations and see what works best for you. Just remember to be careful and have fun!
